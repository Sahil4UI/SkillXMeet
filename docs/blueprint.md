## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#2962FF) for a professional and reliable feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E5EFFF). This will allow the interface elements to pop and reduce eye strain during long sessions.
- Accent color: Analogous blue-violet (#7929FF), for highlights and interactive elements. Use sparingly to draw attention without overwhelming the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, providing a clean, modern, and highly readable typeface suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use clear, modern icons to represent features like screen sharing, chat, and settings.
- Maintain a clean, intuitive layout for ease of use during live sessions.
- Subtle animations to acknowledge user interactions and keep the interface engaging without being distracting.
